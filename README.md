# DRY

Just a repo to dump reusable stuff like github workflows, Earthfiles or just scripts that can be shared across projects that don't really fit anywhere else. 

this is purely for personal usage. If its usefull to you, great, feel free to use any of the workflows, but expect things to change and break without any notice!
